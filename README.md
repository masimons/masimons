### Open Source Contributions

- [usdigitalresponse/usdr-gost](https://github.com/usdigitalresponse/usdr-gost)  
  Supported civic tech efforts by contributing features to GOST (Grants One Stop Tool), a platform that hosts tools to enable state and local government officials to more easily apply for and report on their federal grants. I focused mainly on surfacing forecasted grants to users, giving them more time to prepare applications for future grants.

  Contributed a bug fix to the devour JSON:API client.
